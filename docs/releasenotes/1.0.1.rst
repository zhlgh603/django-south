===========
South 1.0.1
===========

This is a small bugfix release of South with two changes:

- Python 3 compatability has been fixed (it was broken in 1.0 by an accidental
  introduction of ``iteritems()``)

- South will explicitly error if it detects Django 1.7 or above rather than
  failing with cryptic errors.
