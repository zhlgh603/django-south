===========
South 0.8.3
===========

This is the third bugfix release in the 0.8 series.

Major changes are outlined below. A full list of changes can be found on
`the repository <https://bitbucket.org/andrewgodwin/south/commits/all/>`_.

Please note that the 0.8.x series is the last major release branch of South 1;
it will be superceded by South 2 in the coming months, which will be a
forwards-compatable backport of the new Django 1.7 migrations code for Django
1.4, 1.5 and 1.6. A full migration path will, of course, be provided.


Django 1.6 support
==================

A couple of issues with Django 1.6 have been fixed (including bad error
handling and a loaddata incompatability)


Timezone-aware DateTimeFields no longer issue warnings
======================================================

Migrations now import datetime from a special South module which provides
the correct tz-aware or tz-naive version.


SQLite
======

A couple of issues fixed, including double-indexing errors, and  correct
persistence of non-unique indexes across ALTERs.


Localflavor
===========

The new localflavor fields are automatically accepted by the introspector.


Oracle
======

Foreign keys are now updated during an alter_column call.


Firebird
========

A couple of small fixes and documentation patch-ups.
