===========
South 0.8.4
===========

This is the fourth bugfix release in the 0.8 series.

Major changes are outlined below. A full list of changes can be found on
`the repository <https://bitbucket.org/andrewgodwin/south/commits/all/>`_.

Please note that the 0.8.x series is the last major release branch of South 1;
it will be superceded by South 2 in the coming months, which will be a
forwards-compatable backport of the new Django 1.7 migrations code for Django
1.4, 1.5 and 1.6. A full migration path will, of course, be provided.


Fixture loading issues fixed
============================

A regression in 0.8.3 meant that fixtures referring to models outside
of the app they were in, and some other references to custom user models,
were broken. This should now be fixed.
